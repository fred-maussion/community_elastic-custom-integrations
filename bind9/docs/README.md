# Bind9 Integration

The Bind9 integration allows for seamless collection, parsing, enrichment, and indexing of Bind9 DNS server logs using Elasticsearch and Logstash. This setup facilitates real-time monitoring, analysis, and visualization of DNS activity, enabling administrators to detect anomalies, optimize performance, and improve security posture.

## Data Streams

The integration collects:
- **Logs**: Detailed Bind9 event logs that provide insight into DNS queries, responses, server status, and error conditions. This data stream enables tracking of DNS traffic and troubleshooting issues.

## Requirements

You need:
- **Elasticsearch**: For storing, searching, and analyzing data.
- **Kibana**: To visualize and manage the collected logs.
- **Logstash**: For log collection and parsing.
- **Bind9**: Running on supported Linux distributions.

Elasticsearch and Kibana can be deployed using Elastic Cloud or self-hosted. Ensure the Elastic Stack is set up to accept data from Logstash.

## Setup

1. **Install Logstash** on the Bind9 server to collect log data.
2. **Configure the Bind9 log format** to ensure compatibility with Logstash.
3. **Set up Logstash** to forward logs to Elasticsearch with proper parsing and enrichment.
4. **Configure Elasticsearch indices and Kibana dashboards** for DNS monitoring.
